# Work Experience/Extra-curricular activities

- Currently work (part-time) as a student assistant and peer adviser at Mapúa University Makati. August 2025 - Present
  - Basically, I work under the Center for Student Advising (CSA) Department which offers services to support students in addressing academic, personal, social, and career adjustment problems.
  - The main goals are to assist students in developing their academic plans and to help students adjust to college life.
  - I've taught (through the peer adviser tutoring services) other students with subjects they're having a hard time with.

# Education

## Educational background:

- Universities:
  - Mapúa University Makati
    - Degree: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence
    - 2022 - Present
    - Dean's and President's Lister
    - Current GWA: 1.39
  - University of the Philippines Diliman
    - Degree (incomplete): Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering
      - It was COVID at the time and (in my opinion) they didn't handle the "online" part of the teaching very well. Basically didn't mesh well with how the university operated, plus I wanted to switch to Computer Science because of the rise of AI.
    - 2020 - 2022
- Highschool
  - Don Bosco Technical Institute of Makati - STEM
    - 2014 - 2020

# Research Papers and Projects

- Literature Review: [Advanced Phishing Techniques: Analyzing Adversary-in-the-Middle and Browser-in-the-Browser Attacks in Modern Cybersecurity](https://doi.org/10.2478/cait-2025-0004)
  - Researched two sophisticated phishing methods that slip past most traditional security defenses.
  - Analyzed how Adversary-in-the-Middle and Browser-in-the-Browser attacks work in practice, studied real attack cases, and tracked how these techniques keep evolving.
  - Developed practical defense recommendations for cybersecurity teams.
  - Research published in CIT Journal of Computing and Information Technology, Volume 25, Issue 1.
- Capstone Thesis (ongoing): Few-Shot Learning for Occupancy Detection Using Wi-Fi Beamforming Feedback
  - Built a privacy-focused system that detects and counts people using standard Wi-Fi router signals.
  - Combined few-shot learning with Wi-Fi beamforming data to create a solution that adapts to new environments with just 1-10 training samples, drastically cutting deployment time and costs compared to traditional AI models.
  - Led research methodology design, multi-environment data collection strategy, and meta-learning architecture development.
- WebApp: crAIvings - AI-Powered Restaurant Feedback Analysis
  - a web application that leverages artificial intelligence to analyze restaurant reviews, providing actionable insights to restaurant owners and helping diners make informed decisions.
- Coding Project: FindMe: School Lost and Found System
  - A modern, web-based Lost and Found Management System designed to streamline the process of reporting, tracking, and claiming lost items on campus.
- Colemak Without AltGr
  - Modified the Colemak keyboard layout (with Capslock as Backspace) for Windows to be without the AltGr functionality (which I needed for hotkey shortcuts in IDEs like VSCode).
- A bunch of AHKv2 Script projects for various automation tasks
